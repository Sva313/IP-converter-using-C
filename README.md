# Ip Converter

A project which converts binary numbers to decimal and vice versa!


## FAQ

#### Question 1: What happens in the case of malicious inputs?

Answer: The program either terminates, or in the case of the calculations, shows false results.

#### Question 2: How is the conversion executed?

Answer: Through the use of four consecutive while loops, which carry out the calculations.
In detail, we created 3 functions in total: The main, the one whick converts  the     decimal numbers into binary, and the one which converts the binary numbers into decimal.
Depending on the users choice, the corrensponding function is called and executed.


## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? (E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility)

1)We created an automated GUI through the switch function, along with 3 cases, one for each conversion and one for 'false' inputs.
